Publishing Configuration
After installing the package, you may publish the configuration file to customize settings:

This will copy the configuration file to config/config.php where you can adjust the table name and database connection settings.

        'magento_orders' => 'magento_orders_table_name',
    ],
    'connection' => env('MAGENTO_DB_CONNECTION', 'magento_connection'),
];
Make sure to define the magento_connection in your config/database.php file:
 
'connections' => [
    'magento_connection' => [
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'port' => env('DB_PORT', '3306'),
        'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'magento_database'),
        'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'root'),
        'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',

    ],
